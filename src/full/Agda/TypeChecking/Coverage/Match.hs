{-| Given

    1. the function clauses @cs@
    2. the patterns @ps@

we want to compute a variable index of the split clause to split on next.

First, we find the set @cs'@ of all the clauses that are
instances (via substitutions @rhos@) of the split clause.

In these substitutions, we look for a column that has only constructor patterns.
We try to split on this column first.
